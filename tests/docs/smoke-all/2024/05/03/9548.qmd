# Revealjs theme handling

User provided theme should be used to build a `quarto-<hash>.css` using SASS and the `theme: beige` should internally by overridden to `theme: quarto` so that the later is added in Pandoc's template

2024-08-26: `quarto.css` now carries the MD5 hash of the content to allow different revealjs themes to work on the same website.
